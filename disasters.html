    <h2>The Life-Saving Impact of Early Warnings and Preparation</h2>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>The Power of Early Warnings</h2>
      <p>Early warnings transform disasters from sudden chaos to managed events. By providing hours or days of lead time, communities can evacuate safely and prepare effectively. This saves lives and minimizes response scale. Key benefits include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Evacuation and Safety</span>: Residents in high-risk areas move to safety, reducing trapped victims and fatalities.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Resource Positioning</span>: Recovery supplies staged in nearby unaffected locations for rapid distribution.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Faster First Responders</span>: Advance notice allows pre-deployment of teams, shortening response times and enabling quicker medical aid and rescue.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Global data shows effective early warnings reduce disaster mortality by 30–50% (UNDRR, 2025). In ocean-related events, where delays cost thousands of lives, this time is priceless.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Historical Impacts of Major Disasters</h2>
      <p>Lack of early warning often amplified losses. Better preparation could have mitigated them (data from NOAA, UNDRR, WHO, Munich Re, EM-DAT, 1980–2025).</p>

      <h2>Benefits of Preparation Enabled by Early Warnings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Reduced Loss of Life</span>: Early alerts enable evacuation of vulnerable groups and pre-positioning of first responders. A 30-minute warning in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami could have saved over 100,000 lives. Pre-positioned supplies allow faster medical aid.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Environmental Protection</span>: Rapid supply deployment minimizes delayed cleanup and pollution spread.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Faster Response & Cost Savings</span>: Pre-deployed teams limit damage spread — saving billions in restoration. Every $1 in preparedness saves $13 in damages (UNDRR). Global disasters cost $224 billion in 2025; early warnings could reduce losses by 20–50% ($45–112 billion annually).</li>

      <h2>Conclusion: Investing in Early Warning for a Resilient Future</h2>
      <p>Advanced early warning systems enable proactive preparation — evacuation, resource positioning, faster response — dramatically reducing human, environmental, and economic losses. The cost of such technology is a small investment compared to a single disaster's toll — it pays for itself many times over by preventing or minimizing damage and enabling quicker recovery.</p>
