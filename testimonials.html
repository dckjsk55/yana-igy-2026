    <h1>Testimonials & Stories</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Real accounts from people who received YANA–IGY alerts. They share how extra time made a difference — physically, emotionally, and sometimes spiritually.</p>

      <h2>Why These Stories Matter</h2>
      <p>These testimonials show the real impact of more time: time to get to safety, time with loved ones, time to prepare. YANA–IGY is designed to give that time — and we're grateful to hear how it helped.</p>

      <h2>More Time — A Deeper Meaning</h2>
      <p>Many survivors describe how the extra time gave them moments to reflect, pray, or reconnect with loved ones. For some, it was time to get right with God and His Son Jesus Christ, who gave His life so we have a way back to the Father.
